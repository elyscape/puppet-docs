Hiera is a key/value lookup tool for configuration data. Hiera makes Puppet better by keeping site-specific data out of your manifests. Puppet classes can request whatever data they need, and your Hiera data will act like a site-wide config file.

* [Hiera 1.0](/hiera/1/index.html) is compatible with Puppet 3.x and is included in Puppet Enterprise 3.x.
* [Hiera 2.0](/hiera/2.0/index.html) is compatible with Puppet 4.
* [The Hiera release notes](/hiera/latest/release_notes.html) lists the new features and fixes in the latest Hiera version.
