Puppet For New Users: Next Steps
=====

More Resources
-----

### Learning Puppet

The preceding chapters were sprinkled with links to [Learning Puppet](/learning/), our primary resource for new Puppet users. To learn more about how to write classes and modules, how to arrange resources into useful combinations, and how Puppet sees the world, [start at the beginning](/learning/). You can download the Learning Puppet VM to start with, or you can simply use the test nodes you've already installed Puppet Enterprise on. Learning Puppet is a work in progress and is being actively improved.

### More About Resource Types

For a fast, printable reference to the most common resource types, get the [Core Types Cheat Sheet](/puppet_core_types_cheatsheet.pdf). For more detailed info about Puppet's resource types, see the [type reference for your version of Puppet](/references/2.7.6/type.html).

### More About the Puppet Language

For more complete details about the Puppet language, see the [language reference](/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_summary.html).

### More About the Console

For more on Puppet Enterprise's console, see [the console section](./console_navigating.html) of this user's guide.
