What Gets Installed Where?
=====

License File
-----

Your PE license file (which was emailed to you when you purchased Puppet Enterprise) should be placed at `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key`.

Puppet Enterprise can be evaluated with a complementary ten-node license; beyond that, a commercial per-node license is required for use. A license key file will have been emailed to you after your purchase, and the puppet master will look for this key at `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key`. Puppet will log warnings if the license is expired or exceeded, and you can view the status of your license by running `puppet license` at the command line on the puppet master.

To purchase a license, please see the [Puppet Enterprise pricing page](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/how-to-buy/), or contact Puppet Labs at <sales@puppetlabs.com> or (877) 575-9775. For more information on licensing terms, please see [the licensing FAQ](http://www.puppetlabs.com/licensing-faq/). If you have misplaced or never received your license key, please contact <sales@puppetlabs.com>.


Configuration Files
-----

Puppet Enterprise's configuration files all live under `/etc/puppetlabs`, with subdirectories for each of PE's components.

* Puppet's `confdir` is in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`. This directory contains the [`puppet.conf`](/puppet/3.6/reference/config_file_main.html) file, the site manifest (`manifests/site.pp`), and the `modules` directory.
* MCollective's config files are in `/etc/puppetlabs/mcollective`.
* The console's config files are in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet-dashboard`.

Documentation
-----

Man pages for the Puppet subcommands are generated on the fly. To view them, run `puppet man <SUBCOMMAND>`.

The `pe-man` command from previous versions of Puppet Enterprise is still functional, but it is deprecated and is slated for removal in a future release.

Software
-----

All PE software is installed under `/opt/puppet`.

* Executable binaries are in `/opt/puppet/bin` and `/opt/puppet/sbin`.
* Optionally, you can choose at install time to symlink the most common binaries into `/usr/local/bin`.
* The Puppet modules included with PE are installed in `/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules`. Don't edit this directory to add modules of your own; instead, install them in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`.
* MCollective plugins are installed in `/opt/puppet/libexec/mcollective/`. If you are adding new plugins to your PE agent nodes, you should distribute them via Puppet.

Services
-----

PE uses the following services:

- **`pe-puppet`** (on EL platforms) and **`pe-puppet-agent`** (on Debian-based platforms) --- The puppet agent daemon. Runs on every agent node.
- **`pe-httpd`** --- Apache 2, which manages and serves puppet master and the console on servers with those roles. (Note that PE uses Passenger to run puppet master, instead of running it as a standalone daemon.)
- **`pe-mcollective`** --- The MCollective server. Runs on every agent node.
- **`pe-puppet-dashboard-workers`** --- A supervisor that manages the console's background processes. Runs on servers with the console role.
- **`pe-activemq`** --- The ActiveMQ message server, which passes messages to the MCollective servers on agent nodes. Runs on servers with the puppet master role.

User Accounts
-----

PE creates the following users:

- **`peadmin`** --- An administrative account which can issue MCollective client commands. This is the only PE user account intended for use in a login shell. See [the chapter on orchestration](./orchestration_overview.html) for more about this user. This user exists on servers with the puppet master role, and replaces the `mco` user that was present in PE 1.2.
- **`pe-puppet`**  --- A system user which runs the puppet master processes spawned by Passenger.
- **`pe-apache`** --- A system user which runs Apache (`pe-httpd`).
- **`pe-activemq`** --- A system user which runs the ActiveMQ message bus used by MCollective.
- **`puppet-dashboard`** --- A system user which runs the console processes spawned by Passenger.

Log Files
-----

The software distributed with Puppet Enterprise generates the following log files:

### Puppet Master

- `/var/log/pe-httpd/access.log`
- `/var/log/pe-httpd/error.log`

These logs are solely for HTTP activity; the puppet master service logs most of its activity to the syslog service. Your syslog configuration dictates where these messages will be saved, but the default location is `/var/log/messages` on Linux and `/var/adm/messages` on Solaris.

### Puppet Agent

The puppet agent service logs its activity to the syslog service. Your syslog configuration dictates where these messages will be saved, but the default location is `/var/log/messages` on Linux and `/var/adm/messages` on Solaris.

### ActiveMQ

- `/var/log/pe-activemq/wrapper.log`
- `/var/log/pe-activemq/activemq.log`
- `/var/opt/puppet/activemq/data/kahadb/db-1.log`
- `/var/opt/puppet/activemq/data/audit.log`

### Orchestration Service

This log is maintained by the orchestration service, which is installed on all nodes.

- `/var/log/pe-mcollective/mcollective.log`

### Console

- `/var/log/pe-httpd/puppetdashboard.access.log`
- `/var/log/pe-httpd/puppetdashboard.error.log`
- `/var/log/pe-puppet-dashboard/delayed_job.log`
- `/var/log/pe-puppet-dashboard/mcollective_client.log`
- `/var/log/pe-puppet-dashboard/production.log`

### Miscellaneous

These files may or may not be present.

- `/var/log/pe-httpd/other_vhosts_access.log`
- `/var/log/pe-puppet/masterhttp.log`
- `/var/log/pe-puppet/rails.log`
