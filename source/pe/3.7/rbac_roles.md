By assigning roles to users, you can manage them in sets that are granted access permissions to various PE objects. This makes tracking user access more organized and easier to manage. The Roles endpoints enable you to get lists of roles and create new roles.

### Role keys

| Key | Explanation | Example |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `id`          | An integer identifying the role. | `18` |
| `display_name`| The role's name as a string. | `"Viewers"` |
| `description` | A string describing the role's function. | `"View-only permissions"` |
| `permissions` | An array containing permission objects that indicate what permissions a role grants. An empty array is valid. See "Permission keys" for more information. | `[]` |
| `user_ids`,<br />`group_ids` | An array of UUIDs indicating which users and groups are directly assigned to the role. An empty array is valid. | `["fc115750-555a-11e4-916c-0800200c9a66"]` |

## DELETE /roles:rid
Deletes the role identified by the role ID (`:rid`). Users with this role will lose the role and all permissions granted by it immediately, but their session will be otherwise unaffected. Access to the next request that the user makes will be determined by the new set of permissions the user has without this role.

**Returns**

* **200 OK** The role identified by `:rid` has been deleted.
* **404 Not Found** No role exists for id `:rid`.
* **403 Forbidden** The current user lacks permission to delete the role identified by `:rid`.
