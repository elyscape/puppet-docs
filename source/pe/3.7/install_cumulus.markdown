Puppet Enterprise supports the Cumulus Linux operating system as an agent-only platform. There are a number of network devices that run [Cumulus Linux](http://cumulusnetworks.com/support/linux-hardware-compatibility-list/), and these instructions assume you've already installed a supported device, as well as having already [installed Puppet Enterprise](./install_basic.html).

In order to install the Cumulus Linux Puppet agent, you must have access to the Cumulus account on the network device.

Before beginning you will also need to gather:

- The IP address and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Puppet master server.
- The FQDN of the network device that you're installing the Cumulus Linux Puppet agent on.

## Install the Cumulus Linux Puppet Agent

1. From an admin machine, [download][downloadpe] the Cumulus Linux Puppet Agent tarball.
2. Push the tarball to the `/home/cumulus` directory on the network device (e.g., run `scp puppet-enterprise-3.x.x-cumulus-2.2-amd64.tar cumulus@dell-s6000:/home/cumulus`).
3. On the network device, unpack the tarball with `tar xvf puppet-enterprise-3.x.x-cumulus-2.2-amd64.tar`.
4. Navigate to the directory created when you unpacked the PE tarball with `cd puppet-enterprise-3.x.x-cumulus-2.2-amd64`.
4. Use the PE installer to install the Puppet agent. Run `sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer`.
5. Edit `/etc/hosts` so that it includes the IP address of your Puppet master, as well as its FQDN and its default DNS alt name, `puppet`.
6. Run the Puppet agent on the switch with `sudo /opt/puppet/bin/puppet agent -t`.

   This will create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the Puppet agent that you will need to sign from the Puppet master.

7. On the Puppet master, sign the Puppet agent's CSR. Run `puppet cert sign <NETWORK DEVICE'S FQDN>`.
8. On the network device, complete the installation by running Puppet with `sudo /opt/puppet/bin/puppet agent -t`.

   The Puppet agent will retrieve its catalog and will now be fully functional.

> **Next Steps**: Now it's time to begin managing ports, licenses, and interfaces on your network device. Refer to the [Cumulus Linux page](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/cumuluslinux/) on the Puppet Forge for information about modules that will get you started.

## Uninstall the Cumulus Linux Puppet Agent

1. Navigate to the directory created when you unpacked the PE tarball with `cd puppet-enterprise-3.x.x-cumulus-2.2-amd64`.
2. Use the PE uninstaller to uninstall the Puppet agent. Run `sudo ./puppet-enterprise-uninstaller`.
3. On the Puppet master, revoke the cert for the Puppet agent with `puppet cert clean <NETWORK DEVICE'S FQDN>`.

   This will revoke the agent certificate and delete related files on the Puppet master. This will prevent SSL collisions should you want to reinstall the Puppet agent on the same device.
