[Preconfigured Node Groups]: ./console_classes_groups_preconfigured_groups.html

Puppet Enterprise (PE) 3.3 comes with the following preconfigured node groups and node classification, which it uses to manage its own components and infrastructure:

Node groups:

* `default`
* `no mcollective`
* `mcollective`
* `puppet_master`
* `puppet_console`

Node classification:

* `pe_puppetdb`
* `puppet_enterprise::license`
* `pe_postgresql`
* `pe_mcollective`

The migration tool detects these preconfigured groups and classification and does not export them. This is because PE 3.8 uses a slightly different set of preconfigured infrastructure groups and classification, which get installed when you upgrade.

After you have upgraded to PE 3.8 and imported your PE 3.3 classification data, you can create rules in the PE 3.8 preconfigured node groups to match the appropriate nodes and classify them with the infrastructure classes. For detailed information regarding the preconfigured node groups in PE 3.8, see [Preconfigured Node Groups][].

> **Warning:** Any classification that you set in the `default` node group in PE 3.3 will not be migrated.

> **Note:** Unlike the other infrastructure classes, the `pe_repo` class **is not** removed from your PE 3.3 node classification during the migration process. If you have added the `pe_repo` class to other nodes besides the PE master node, those nodes will still get this classification after the migration.

> **Note:** In PE 3.3, if you have set up any node groups that are descendents of the preconfigured node groups listed above, the descendent node groups will **not** be migrated to PE 3.8.

> **Note:** If you have created groups in PE 3.3 and added any of the PE infrastructure classes directly to those groups, the migration tool will **not** remove those classes from your groups. After completing the migration, you will need to remove the PE infrastructure classes from these groups.
>
> Rather than creating your own groups for managing PE components, we advise pinning nodes to the new preconfigured node groups in PE 3.8; for more info, see [Preconfigured Node Groups][].

The migration tool also detects any node groups in PE 3.3 that have the same name as a preconfigured node group in PE 3.8 and warns you that you need to rename them. The names of preconfigured node groups in PE 3.8 are:

* `default`
* `Agent-specified environment`
* `Production environment`
* `PE ActiveMQ Broker`
* `PE Certificate Authority`
* `PE Console`
* `PE Infrastructure`
* `PE Master`
* `PE MCollective`
* `PE PuppetDB`
* `PE Agent`
