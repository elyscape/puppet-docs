## Puppet Enterprise 3.8 (April 28, 2015)

### Security Fixes

#### CWE - Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) Vulnerability

Posted April 28, 2015

Some endpoints in the Puppet Enterprise console are potentially susceptible to cross-frame scripting (XFS) attacks. An exploit would coerce a PE user into navigating to an attacker-controlled web page that loaded the Puppet Enterprise console in an HTML frame.

This issue affected PE 3.7.x. It's resolved in PE 3.8.0.

#### OpenSSL March 2015 Security Fixes

Posted April 28, 2015

On March 19, the OpenSSL project announced several security vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 3.8.0 contained vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. Puppet Enterprise 3.8.0 contains updated versions of OpenSSL that have patched the vulnerabilities.

For more information about the OpenSSL vulnerabilities, refer to the [OpenSSL security announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20150319.txt).

These issues affected PE 2.x and 3.x. They're resolved in PE 3.8.0.

#### Oracle Java April 2015 Security Fixes

Posted April 28, 2015

On April 14th, Oracle announced several security vulnerabilities in Java. Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 3.8.0 contained a vulnerable version of Java. Puppet Enterprise 3.8.0 contains an updated version of Java that has patched the vulnerabilities.

For more information about the Java vulnerabilities, refer to the [Oracle security announcement](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2015-2365600.html).

These issues affected PE 3.x. They're resolved in PE 3.8.0.

#### PostgreSQL February 2015 Security Fixes

Posted April 28, 2015

On February 5th, the PostgreSQL project announced several security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL. The impact of these vulnerabilities includes information leakage, denial of service, SQL injection, and possible privilege escalation. However, all of the vulnerabilities require prior database authentication.

Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 3.8.0 contained a vulnerable version of PostgreSQL. Puppet Enterprise 3.8.0 contains an updated version of PostgreSQL that has patched the vulnerabilities.

For more information on the PostgreSQL vulnerabilities, please see the [PostgreSQL announcement](http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1569/).

These issues affected PE 3.x. They're resolved in PE 3.8.0.

#### CVE - Ruby OpenSSL Hostname Verification

Posted April 28, 2015

Vulnerabilities in Ruby’s OpenSSL extension allow overly permissive matching of hostnames, particularly when using wildcard SSL certificates.

Puppet Enterprise does not generate wildcard SSL certificates by default. However, if a PE infrastructure has been configured with wildcard SSL certificates, it could theoretically be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

For more information on the vulnerability, please see the [Ruby project’s announcement](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/04/13/ruby-openssl-hostname-matching-vulnerability/).

These issues affected PE 3.x and Puppet-Agent 1.0. They're resolved in PE 3.8.0.

#### CVE - LibYAML Vulnerability Could Allow Denial of Service

Posted April 28, 2015

A flaw in the LibYAML library’s parsing of wrapped strings could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service by loading a specially crafted YAML document.

This issue affected PE 3.x. It's resolved in PE 3.8.0

### Bug Fixes

Puppet Enterprise 3.8 contains a number of performance and documentation improvements, in addition to the fixes that are highlighted below.

#### Static Defaults Were Set for TK-Jetty `max threads`

Previously, in PE, tk-jetty `max threads` were set to a static default of 100 threads. We determined this was too low for large environments with high CPU counts, and we no longer set a default for `max threads`. Unless you specify a value, we will not manage or define this setting. You can tune `max threads` for the [PE console/console API](./console_config.html#tuning-max-threads-on-the-pe-console-and-console-api) or [Puppet Server](./config_puppetserver.html#tuning-max-threads-on-puppet-server) as needed using Hiera.

#### Custom Console Cert Functionality Was Broken in PE 3.7.x

In PE 3.7.x users could not set custom certificates for the PE console. This release corrects that issue, but if you're upgrading from PE 3.3.2, note that cert functionality has changed in PE 3.8. If needed, refer to [Configuring the Puppet Enterprise Console to Use a Custom SSL Certificate](./custom_console_cert.html) for instructions on re-configuring your custom console certificate.

#### Agent Installation No Longer Sets `environment = production`

This release corrects an issue in which agents' environments were set to `production` during the installation process (in `puppet.conf`). This behavior was undesirable if users wanted to set agents' environments with the node classifier.

#### Agent Server Setting Moved to `[main]` in `puppet.conf`

The agent server setting is now set in the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`; in previous versions, it was set in the `[agent]` section. This fix makes it possible to use the agent installation script to install compile masters and ActiveMQ hubs and spokes in large environment installations.

#### ActiveMQ Spokes Can Be Managed from Profile Level

ActiveMQ spokes (brokers) can now have their collectives set and managed in PE from the profile level, using the `excluded_collectives` and `included_collectives` parameters in the `puppet_enterprise::profile::amq::broker` class. This functionality was not available from the profile level in PE 3.7.x.

#### ActiveMQ/MCollective Network Connections Failed when Sending Commands to Targeted Spokes

Due to a misconfigured setting in PE (`puppet_enterprise::amq::config::network_connector`), ActiveMQ/MCollective network connections failed on occasion. Specifically, the connections failed when a ActiveMQ hub was sending commands to targeted spokes (brokers) in large environment installations. This is fixed in PE 3.8.

#### Changes to ActiveMQ Heap Size Did Not Restart `pe-activemq` Service

In PE 3.7.x, when users changed the ActiveMQ heap size, the change did not trigger the `pe-activemq` service to restart, and thus PE did not pick up the changes. PE 3.8 corrects this issue, and the service is now restarted when changes are made.

#### Fix for Tuning Classifier Synchronization Period

This fix raises the node classifier's default synchronization period from 180 to 600 seconds. It also introduces a [tunable setting](./console_config.html#tuning-the-classifier-synchronization-period) via the PE console.

#### Setting `https_proxy` Prevented Service Checks During Installation/Upgrade with `curl`

When users ran the PE installer/upgrader behind a proxy, PE could not properly `curl` PE services during installation/upgrade. This fix corrects the issue by unsetting `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `http_proxy` before performing `curl` commands to PE services during installs/upgrades.

#### Node Classifier Ignored Facts That Were False

When creating node matching rules in PE 3.7, the node classifier ignored all facts with a boolean value of `false`. For example, if you created a rule like `is_virtual` `is` `false`, the rule would never match a node. This issue has been resolved in PE 3.8.

#### Browser Crashing Issue When Returning a Null Value for `inherited_role_ids`

In PE 3.7.2, the browser would crash when the `users` endpoint for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) returned a `NULL` value for `inherited_role_ids`. A `NULL` value is returned when you delete the user roles for a user group and then view the user. In PE 3.8, this has been fixed and the browser no longer crashes.

#### Browser Crashing Issue When Deleting a Node Group That Had a Permission Assigned

In PE 3.7, pages didn't completely render if you took the following steps:

- Create a new user role in RBAC.
- Add a permission to the user role that has the **Node groups** permission type.
- Select a specific node group instance that the permission applies to.
- Delete the node group instance that the permission applies to.
- Try to go to the **Permissions** tab for the new user role.

The issue was that the Javascript rendering the page stops prematurely.

In PE 3.8, this has been fixed so that the page renders properly. In the PE 3.8 console, if you go to the **Permissions** tab for the new role that was added, the deleted node group instance is displayed as a dash in the **Object** column.

#### Node Classifier Returned Activity Service Error When Importing a Large Number of Groups

In PE 3.7, an error indicating that the "index row size exceeds maximum" was returned when importing a large number of groups (for example, when upgrading a large environment to PE 3.7). This error was returned even if the import was successful. In PE 3.8, this error no longer occurs.

#### Newly Created Node Group Did Not Appear in List of Parents

When you created a new node group in the PE 3.7 console, then immediately created another new node group and tried to select the first node group as the parent, the first node group did not appear in the list of selectable names in the **Parent name** drop-down list. The first node group would appear if you reloaded the page. This issue has been fixed in PE 3.8.

#### Could Only Accept Or Reject One Node at a Time

In PE 3.7, if you had multiple node requests pending, you could accept/reject one node, but if you then tried to accept/reject subsequent nodes, a 403 Forbidden error was returned. This meant that if you wanted to accept/reject node requests one at a time, you had to refresh the page after each time you accepted/rejected a node request. In PE 3.8, this issue has been fixed, and you will no longer receive a 403 Forbidden error.

#### User and Group Lookup Attributes Were Case Sensitive

In earlier releases, the RBAC service required you to use the correct case when specifying lookup attributes for external directories. In PE 3.8, lookup attributes are not case sensitive.

#### MCollective `puppet-agent` Plugin Now Works When Puppet Service Is Running

Previously, the MCO puppet agent plugin didn't let a user trigger a remote `noop` run or specify an environment if the `pe-puppet` service was running. It assumed that we were using cron instead of the `pe-puppet` service. Now you can trigger a run while the service is running.

#### Issue Creating Multiple Mirrors in zpool Resource

The fix enables you to differentiate between single and multi-mirror and raidz pools and ensures that `mirror` and `raidz` can be used as subcommands.

#### `/var/lib/peadmin/.mcollective.d` Has the Wrong Permissions

In PE 3.7.0 the `.mcollective.d` directory was assigned a `0400` permission. This created an issue when the client.log was full, and `peadmin` needed to create another one for shifting the logfile. If a logfile was full, and you tried to use MCollective to issue commands, you'd get an error message that said log shifting had failed and permission was denied. The fix sets the permissions to u+rwx for the PE admin user.

#### `pe-mcollective-metadata` Cron Redirected Output to a Path That Was Not Valid on AIX

The fix updated the manifest to use `puppet_enterprise::params::mco_logdir`, which evaluates to the appropriate log directory for AIX. The cron job now points at the correct location, `/opt/freeware/var/log/pe-mcollective`.

#### PE Removed Unmanaged Crontab Entries from Root If Invalid Entries Were Present

Due to this bug, the MCollective metadata cron job was unconditionally laid
down during PE installation. This caused problems if invalid root crontabs were present. It would then trigger a bug that removed any unmanged cron entries. The fix adds a toggle that allowed the cron job to be unmanaged, to avoid triggering this bug. An exec was
also added to ensure that the fact cache is present so that `pe-mcollective` can start.
