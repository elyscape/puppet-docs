The following are common configuration tasks that you can manage with Puppet Enterprise. These steps provide an excellent introduction to the capabilities of PE.

## NTP Quick Start Guide
NTP is one of the most crucial, yet easiest, services to configure and manage with PE. Follow [this guide](./quick_start_ntp.html) to properly get time synced across all your PE-managed nodes.

## DNS Quick Start Guide
[This guide](./quick_start_dns.html) provides instructions for getting started managing a simple DNS nameserver file with PE. A nameserver ensures that the “human-readable” names you type in your browser (e.g., `google.com`) can be resolved to IP addresses your computers can read.
