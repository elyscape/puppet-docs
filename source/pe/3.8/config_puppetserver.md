We recommend tuning the following settings as needed to improve the performance of your Puppet Server.

### Tuning JRuby on Puppet Server

This setting controls the maximum number of JRuby instances to allow on the Puppet Server. The default used in PE 3.8 is the number of CPUs + 2, which is expressed as `$::processorcount` + 2.

For servers with high numbers of CPUs, this default can lead to an over-provisioning of JRuby processes. Each process consumes resources such as RAM, CPU time and open files (controlled by ulimits). With too many JRuby processes, Puppet Server may behave inefficiently or consume more than the available amount of resources.

To increase or decrease the number of JRuby instances, you need to edit your Hiera default `.yaml` file, and tune the `jruby_max_active_instances` by setting the following code:

	puppet_enterprise::master::puppetserver::jruby_max_active_instances: <number of instances>

### Tuning `max threads` on Puppet Server

This sets the maximum number of threads assigned to respond to HTTP and HTTPS requests, effectively changing how many concurrent requests can be made to Puppet Server at one time. This setting should be increased to 150 max threads for nodes where `$::processorcount` is greater than 32.

To increase the max threads, edit your Hiera default `.yaml` file with the following code:

         puppet_enterprise::master::puppetserver::tk_jetty_max_threads: <number of max threads>

### Increasing the ulimit for the `pe-puppet` User
The ulimit controls the number of processes and file handles that the `pe-puppet` user can open/process. To increase the ulimit for the `pe-puppet` user, edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` so that it contains the following:

     pe-puppet hard	nofile      65535

### Tuning Java Args for Puppet Server

You can increase the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) memory that is allocated to Java services running on Puppet Server. This memory allocation is known as the Java heap size.

Instructions for using the PE console to increase the Java heap size are detailed on on the [Configuring Java Arguments for PE](./config_java_args.html#pe-puppet-server-service) page.

### Tuning the Environment Timeout

The [setting](/puppet/3.7/reference/environments_configuring.html#environmenttimeout) for `environment_timeout` controls how long the Puppet master caches data it loads from an environment. When you make changes to an environment's Puppet code, this setting determines how much time will pass before those changes are reflected in the environment. Please review the `environment_timeout` documentation, as you will probably want to tune this setting per environment depending on your needs.

There is a CPU cost to refresh the environment cache, so when tuning for performance we advise you set `environment_timeout`  to `unlimited`. This will generally improve catalog compilation times by never refreshing the environment cache. As mentioned in the linked docs you will need a way to flush this cache when you want Puppet code updates to take effect.
