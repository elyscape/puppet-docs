## Overview

The following quick start guide introduces the essential components of Puppet module writing. In this guide, you will write a simple *nix-based module that contains two classes---one that will manage your motd (message of the day) and one that will create a notification on on the command line when you run Puppet.

While the module you'll write doesn't have an incredible amount of functionality, you'll learn the basic module directory structure and how to apply classes using the PE console. You'll encounter more complex module writing scenarios in other quick start guides.

## Write the `helloworld` Class

Some modules can be large, complex, and require a significant amount of trial and error. This module will be a very simple module to write; it contains just two classes.

> ### A Quick Note about Modules
>
>The first thing to know is that, by default, the modules you use to manage nodes are located in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules`---this includes modules installed by PE, those that you download from the Forge, and those you write yourself.
>
>**Note**: PE also installs modules in `/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules`, but don’t modify anything in this directory or add modules of your own to it.

Modules are directory trees. For this task, you'll create the following files:

 - `helloworld` (the module name)
   - `manifests/`
      - `init.pp` (contains the `helloworld` class)
      - `motd.pp` (contains a file resource that ensures the creation of the MOTD)

**To write the `helloworld` class**:

1. From the command line on the Puppet master, navigate to the modules directory (`cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules`).
2. Run `mkdir -p helloworld/manifests` to create the new module directory and its manifests directory.
3. In the `manifests` directory, use your text editor to create the `init.pp` file, and edit it so that it contains the following Puppet code.

        class helloworld {

           notify { 'hello, world!': }

        }

4. Save and exit the file.
5. In the `manifests` directory, use your text editor to create the `motd.pp` file, and edit it so that it contains the following Puppet code.

        class helloworld::motd {

           file { '/etc/motd':
           owner  => 'root',
           group  => 'root',
           mode    => 0644,
           content => "hello, world!\n",
           }

        }

6. Save and exit the file.

> That's it! You've written a module that contains two classes that will, once applied, show a notification message when Puppet runs, and manage the motd on your server---we'll take a closer at these actions after we add the classes. Please note that you'll need to wait a short time for the Puppet server to refresh before the classes are available to add to your nodes.

## Add the `helloworld` and `helloworld::motd` Classes in the Console

[classification_selector]: ./images/quick/classification_selector.png

For this procedure, you're going to add the `helloworld` classes to a node group you'll create, called **HelloWorld**, which will contain all of your nodes. Depending on your needs or infrastructure, you may have a different group that you'll assign NTP to, but these same instructions would apply.

**To create the HelloWorld node group**:

1. From the console, click __Classification__ in the top navigation bar.

   ![classification selection][classification_selector]

2. In the **Node group name** field, name your group **HelloWorld**.
3. Click **Add group**.

   **Note**: Leave the **Parent name** and **Environment** values as their defaults (**default** and **production**, respectively).

4. From the __Classification page__, select the __HelloWorld__ group, and click the __Rules_ tab.
5. In the **Fact** field, enter "name" (without the quotes).
6. From the **Operator** drop-down list, select **matches regex**.
7. In the **Value** field, enter ".x" (without the quotes).
8. Click **Add rule**.

   This rule will ["dynamically" pin all nodes]((./console_classes_groups.html#adding-nodes-dynamically) to the **HelloWorld** group. (Note that this rule is for testing purposes and that decisions about pinning nodes to groups in a production environment will vary from user to user.)

**To add the** `helloworld` **classes to the NTP group**:

1. From the __Classification page__, select the __HelloWorld_ group.

2. Click the __Classes__ tab.

3. In the __Class name__ field, begin typing `helloworld`, and select it from the autocomplete list.

4. Click __Add class__.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add the `helloworld::motd` class.

5. Click the **Commit change** button.

   **Note**: The `helloworld` classes now appear in the list of classes for the __HelloWorld_ group, but they have not yet been configured on your nodes. For that to happen, you need to kick off a Puppet run.

7. From the CLI of your Puppet master, run `puppet agent -t`.

8. From the CLI of your PE-managed node(s), run `puppet agent -t`.

   This will configure the nodes using the newly-assigned classes.

### Viewing the Results

After you kick off the Puppet run, you should see the following on the command line as the `helloworld` class is applied:

    [root@master manifests]# puppet agent -t
    Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
    Info: Retrieving plugin
    Info: Loading facts
    Info: Caching catalog for master.example.com
    Info: Applying configuration version '1416331291'
    Notice: hello, world!
    Notice: /Stage[main]/Helloworld/Notify[hello, world!]/message: defined 'message' as 'hello, world!'
    Notice: Finished catalog run in 9.42 seconds

Now run `cat /etc/motd`. The result should show, `hello, world!`
