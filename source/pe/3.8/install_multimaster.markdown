The following guide provides instructions for adding additional Puppet masters to large environment installations (those managing more than 1000 agent nodes). Using additional Puppet masters in an LEI will provide quicker, more efficient compilation times as multiple masters can share request load when agent nodes run. Typically, in LEI configurations, the additional Puppet masters are referred to as **compile masters** and your original Puppet master is referred to as the CA server or **Master of Masters (MoM)**.

Please be sure to review these procedures before beginning, as performing these steps out of order can cause problems for your configurations.

In addition, please note the following about this guide:

- These instructions reference a split installation (separate servers for the Puppet master, PE console, and PuppetDB), which is the recommended installation type for managing more than 500 agent nodes.
- It’s assumed all servers are running the same OS and architecture.
- The following hostnames are used:
   - **Puppet master/CA server (MoM)**: `master.example.com`.
   - **PE console**: `console.example.com`.
   - **PuppetDB**: `puppetdb.example.com`.
   - **Compile master**: `add.master.example.com`.

> **Note**: In this scenario, `master.example.com` functions as both the MoM and the CA server for this deployment.

> **Prerequisite**: You need to be able to resolve hostnames between machines.

### Step 1: Install Puppet Enterprise

1. Follow the [PE split installation documentation](./install_pe_split.html) to install PE.
2. Log in to the console.
3. Continue to [Step 2: Install Additional Puppet Master Node](#step-2-install-additional-puppet-master-node).

### Step 2: Install Compile Master Node

In this step, you will install the additional Puppet agent on `add.master.example.com`. You must perform this step to install the Puppet agent on the new compile master node.

**Warning**: This machine (e.g., the new compile master) should NOT already have a Puppet agent installed.

**To install the additional compile master agent**:

1. SSH into `add.master.example.com` and run `curl -k https://<MASTER.EXAMPLE.COM>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash -s main:dns_alt_names=<COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF ALT NAMES FOR THE PUPPET MASTER> main:environmentpath=</etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments OR YOUR MASTER'S ENVIRONMENT PATH>`.

   **Note**: The `dns_alt_names` value should be set to a comma-separated list of any alternative names that may be used by Puppet agents to connect to the master. The installation uses "puppet" by default.

   This will install and configure the PE agent on `add.master.example.com`.

2. From the command line of `master.example.com`, run `puppet cert --allow-dns-alt-names sign add.master.example.com`.

   **Note**: You cannot use the console to sign certs for nodes with DNS alt names.

3. From the command line on `add.master.example.com`, run `puppet agent -t`.

4. Continue to [Step 3: Classify the New Compile Master Node](#step-3-classify-the-new-compile-master-node).

### Step 3: Classify the New Compile Master Node

[classification_selector]: ./images/quick/classification_selector.png

In this step, you will use the PE console to classify `add.master.example.com` so that it can function as a Puppet master and proxy requests to the PE certificate authority.

> **Important**: For fresh installations of PE 3.8.0, node groups in the classifier are created and configured during the installation process. For upgrades, these groups and classes are created but no nodes are pinned to them. This is done to help prevent errors during the upgrade process. If you’re performing these steps after an upgrade to 3.8.0, refer to [the PE Master group preconfiguration docs](./console_classes_groups_preconfigured_groups.html#the-pe-master-group) to ensure the PE Master group has the correct classes .

**To classify the new compile master node**:

1. From the console, click __Classification__ in the top navigation bar.

   ![classification selection][classification_selector]

2. From the __Classification page__, select the __PE Master__ group.
3. From the __Rules__ tab, in the __Node name__ field, enter `add.master.example.com`.
4. Click __Pin node__.
5. Click the __Commit changes__ button.
6. Continue to [Step 4: Run Puppet on Selected Nodes](#step-4-run-puppet-on-selected-nodes)

### Step 4: Run Puppet on Selected Nodes

In this step, you will need to run Puppet in the order specified so that certificate information for the new compile master can be added to PuppetDB's certificate whitelist. You will need to run Puppet on the PE console node for the RBAC whitelist as well.

>**Important**: The following Puppet runs **MUST** be done in the order listed in the following steps. The new compile master (`add.master.example.com`) must complete a full Puppet run before you run Puppet on the PuppetDB and console nodes.

**To run Puppet on selected nodes**:

1. From the console, navigate to __Live Management__.
2. Select the __Control Puppet__ tab.
3. On the left-hand side of the __Live Management__ page, ensure no nodes are selected; click __Select none__.
4. From the node list, select **only** `add.master.example.com`.
5. Select __runonce__.
6. Click __Run__ and wait until the run completes.

   **Tip**: To determine when the run is complete, click **return to action list**, then click **status**, then click **run**. The **message** parameter will indicate if PE is currently applying a catalog or is running.


7. Repeat steps 3 - 6 of this section to run Puppet only on `puppetDB.example.com`.
8. Repeat steps 3 - 6 of this section to run Puppet only on `console.example.com`.

> **Done!** `add.master.example.com` is now a compile master node. To start using it, you will first need to add it to your load balancer.

### A Note About Load Balancers

Load balancing is a critical need for PE deployments using multiple Puppet masters. Unfortunately, load balancer integration is beyond the scope of this document. However, when configuring load balancers with your PE masters, you need to ensure traffic can pass through port **8140**---this is the port that handles Puppet master and CA traffic.

#### Using Load Balancers in a Large Environment Installation

If you use a load balancer in your LEI, you may want to point the agent installation script at the load balancer when installing new agents. However, if you bring in any new compile masters, they will need to be pointed at the CA server or MoM. In order to successfully use a load balancer, you'll need to:

1. Enable agent installation via your load balancer
2. Enable additional compile master installation (such that those agents don't request configuration via the load balancer)

Step 1: Enable agent installation via your load balancer

1. From the console, click __Classification__ in the top navigation bar.
2. From the __Classification page__, select the __PE Master__ group.
3. Click the __Classes__ tab, and find the `pe_repo` class.
4. From the __Parameter__ drop-down list, select __Master__.
5. In the __Value__ field, enter the FQDN of your load balancer (e.g., `loadbalancer.example.com`).
6. Click __Add parameter__ and then the __Commit change__ button.
7. From the command line of the agent node, run `curl -k https://<LOADBALANCER.EXAMPLE.COM>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash`.

Step 2: Enable additional compile master installation

1. From the console, click __Classification__ in the top navigation bar.
2. From the __Classification page__, in the __Node group name__ field, enter a name for the compile masters node group (e.g., __Compile Masters__).
3. From the __Parent name__ drop-down list, select the __PE Master__ group, and then click __Add group__.
4. Select the __Compile Masters__ group, and from the __Rules__ tab, in the __Node name__ field, enter the FQDNs of your compile master(s).
5. Click the __Classes__ tab, and in the __Add new class__ field, enter `pe_repo`.
6. From the __Parameter__ drop-down list, select __Master__.
7. In the __Value__ field, enter the FQDN of your original Puppet master/CA server (e.g. in the examples above, `master.example.com`).
8. Click __Add parameter__ and then the __Commit change__ button.
9. From the command line of the new compile master, run `curl -k https://<MASTER.EXAMPLE.COM>:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash`.

### A Note About File Syncing

In a multi-master environment, you want to make sure your manifests, modules, and any Hiera data are properly synced between Puppet masters.  Depending on your security and infrastructure needs, there are a range of options for setting up file syncing between your Puppet masters. We recommend choosing from one of the following methods:

- [r10K](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k)
- Network File Systems (NFS)
- Remote Sync (rysnc)
