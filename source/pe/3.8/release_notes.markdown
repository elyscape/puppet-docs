This page describes new features and general improvements in the latest Puppet Enterprise (PE) release.

For more information about this release, see [Known Issues](./release_notes_known_issues.html) and [Security and Bug Fixes](./release_notes_security.html).

## New Features in PE 3.8.0

### Classification Data Migration Tool for Upgrades From PE 3.3

PE 3.8 comes with a migration tool to help you migrate PE 3.3 classification data to PE 3.8.

In PE 3.7, we introduced a new node classifier, which allowed for greater automation but wasn't compatible with some of the ways PE 3.3 classified nodes. The migration tool helps you migrate PE 3.3 nodes and classification to the new node classifier, and provides guidance on fixing classifications that aren't compatible with PE 3.8.

For details about the changes to node classification and important instructions on how to migrate your classification data to PE 3.8, see [the migration tool documentation](./install_upgrade_migration_tool.html).

### r10k Code Management Tool and Quick Start Guide

This release adds [r10k](./r10k.html), a code management tool that lets you use your Git repositories to manage the configuration and contents of your Puppet [environments][] (such as production, development, or testing).

Read [the r10k quick start guide](./quick_start_r10k.html) to get started. In this walkthrough, you'll use the code you wrote for the [Hello, World! QSG](./quick_start_helloworld.html) to learn how r10k can help you deploy different versions of code across different environments.

### Razor Now Fully Supported

[razor]: ./razor_intro.html

[Razor][], Puppet Labs’ tool for provisioning bare metal servers, has moved from tech preview to a fully supported solution. With Razor's policy-based approach, you can automatically discover bare-metal hardware, dynamically configure operating systems and/or hypervisors, and hand nodes off to PE for workload configuration. What used to take hours of manual work now takes minutes. See the [Razor documentation][razor] to learn more.

### Puppet Agent on Network Devices

Thanks to a number of partnerships, Puppet Enterprise has been adding support for running Puppet agent on network devices. Currently we support the [Cumulus Linux](./install_cumulus.html) and the [Arista EOS](./install_eos.html) platforms.

### Puppet 4 Language Parser

The Puppet 4 language parser gives you valuable language features, makes debugging easier, and will help keep your Puppet code compatible with future releases in the next major series. During new installations, you'll be asked if you want to turn on the new  language parser---this is recommended for all **NEW** Puppet users.

If you'll be using Puppet code you did **NOT** create with the Puppet 4 language parser, **DO NOT** enable this feature. See the [Puppet 4 language parser docs](http://links.puppetlabs.com/future_parser) for instructions on enabling the parser in a test environment to ensure it works with your existing Puppet code.

## Improvements in PE 3.8.0

### PE 3.8 Tagmail Users Should Use the puppetlabs-tagmail Module

If you want to use tagmail in PE 3.8, you need the [puppetlabs-tagmail module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/tagmail), available from the Puppet Forge. Puppet 3.8 still includes `tagmail.conf`, but PE users should refer to the module, as the built-in tagmail feature will be completely removed in a future release.

### String Interpolation in the PE Console

In prior PE versions, you could only enter literal values for parameters and variables in the console.

Now, when entering string values for parameters and variables, you can interpolate fact values and limited expressions. This makes it possible to use values like `"I live at $ipaddress"`, which interpolates the value of the `$ipaddress` fact, as well as values such as `${$os["release"]["full"]}`, which interpolates the result of the embedded expression.

For more information on the syntax and restrictions for string interpolation in the console, see [Tips on specifying parameter and variable values](./console_classes_groups.html#setting-class-parameters).

### Upgrades for Large Environment Installations

Upgrading your large environment installation (LEI) involves a combination of steps that you must perform across your core Puppet Enterprise components, your compile masters, and your ActiveMQ hubs and spokes. The [LEI upgrade doc](./install_lei_upgrade.html) details the steps you’ll perform to upgrade your LEI from PE 3.7.2 to 3.8.0.

### Deleting a User From RBAC

There is a new endpoint in the Role-Based Access Control API that lets you delete a local or remote user from PE. For more information, see the [API documentation](./rbac_users.html#delete-userssid).

### Deleting a User Group From RBAC

There is a new endpoint in the Role-Based Access Control API that lets you delete a local or remote user group from PE. For more information, see the [API documentation](./rbac_usergroups.html#delete-groupssid).

### Verifying Certificates for External LDAP Directories

When configuring the RBAC service to connect to an external directory server, you can now verify an SSL certificate for the server. For more information, see the [RBAC documentation](./rbac_ldap.html#verify-directory-server-certificates).

### New RBAC Permission to Edit Parameters and Variables

This permission allows a user in the given user role to tune classification by editing parameters and variables in a class, without giving the user permission to add or delete classes.

## Deprecations in PE 3.8.0

### Cloud Provisioner is Deprecated

Cloud Provisioner is deprecated in this release and will eventually be removed from Puppet Enterprise. For this reason, Cloud Provisioner is no longer installed by default. If you have been using Cloud Provisioner in your existing PE infrastructure and would like to continue using it, you can install it separately, as described in the [Installing section of Cloud Provisioner documentation](./cloudprovisioner_configuring.html#installing).

Instead of Cloud Provisioner, we recommend using the [AWS Supported Module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/aws) going forward.

### Live Management is Deprecated

Live Management is deprecated in PE 3.8.0 and will be replaced by improved resource management functionality in future releases. For this reason, Live Management is no longer enabled by default. If you have been using Live Management in your existing PE infrastructure and would like to continue using it with PE 3.8, see the instructions for [enabling Live Management](./console_navigating_live_mgmt.html#disablingenabling-live-management).

### Some Platforms are Deprecated for PE Infrastructure Components

A number of platforms have been deprecated in PE 3.8 for PE's infrastructure components (the Puppet master, the PE console, and PuppetDB) and will be removed in future versions of PE. Agents on these platforms will continue. The deprecated platforms include all 32-bit versions, all Debian versions, EL 5 versions, and Ubuntu 10.4. The complete list is as follows:

*	centos-5-i386
*   centos-5-x86_64
