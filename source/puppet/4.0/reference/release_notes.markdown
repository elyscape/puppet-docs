These are the release notes for Puppet 4.0, released April 15 2015. There's a lot of information here so it's organized top to bottom by size of impact -- things everyone is going to notice will be at the top and minor bugfixes/improvements are down at the bottom.

## BREAK: Changes to Platform Support, Repos, and Installation

### All-in-One Packaging

The first thing you'll notice is that the packaging has changed pretty dramatically. Puppet had gotten complicated enough, and the systems it runs on diverse enough, that it became really difficult to provide the proverbial "one-click install" through our Linux-distribution style packaging. For Puppet 4, we've gone to an All-In-One package (which we refer to as "AIO", like a bad hand in Words With Friends), which includes Puppet 4, both Facter 2.4 and CFacter 0.4, the latest Hiera and Mcollective, as well Ruby 2.1.5, OpenSSL 1.0.0r, and our gem dependencies. The package installs into its own area in `/opt/puppetlabs` and is named `puppet-agent` so it will not auto-upgrade existing systems with the `puppet` package installed (it will, however, _replace_ them if you opt-in to the upgrade).

* [PUP-4003: Puppet 4.0.0 should update to MCO 2.8.0 and Hiera 2.0.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4003)
* [PUP-3848: Puppet 4.0.0 should update Ruby to 2.1.5 and Facter to 2.4.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3848)

* [PUP-4189: Add all per-user directories to file_paths specification](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4189)

### BREAK: New Locations for Important Files and Directories

Related to the AIO packaging changes, there are new locations on the filesystem for the binaries, configuration, and code. The goals were to make a unified filesystem layout for all Puppet/PE installations and to enable continuous-deployment workflows with r10k. There's a [separate top-level guide](./whered_it_go.html) which summarizes the changes.

* [PUP-3809: Separate code (content?) and configuration directories for AIO packaging](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3809)
* [PUP-3846: Puppet 4.0 MSI Changes - Windows Unified Installer](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3846)
* [PUP-3632: Update paths and defaults for the unified FS layout](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3632)
* [PUP-3944: Make sure puppetdb.conf is under $confdir](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3944)
* [PUP-4001: Packaging should create default module directories for puppet](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4001)

### The End of Ruby 1.8.7

One of the benefits of the All-in-One packaging is no longer being dependent on the version of Ruby provided by the different operating system. This let us consolidate on a fast, stable, modern version -- Ruby 2.1.5 -- across all operating systems (including Windows) and remove a ton of hacky work-arounds left over from the Ruby 1.8.7 days.

If you're using the AIO packaging, the whole Puppet toolset (facter, mcollective, etc) will all work out of the box; if you're running from gem or source, however, make sure you're running a recent Ruby interpreter.

* [PUP-3776: Upgrade Windows Ruby to 2.1.5](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3776)
* [PUP-1805: Drop Ruby 1.8.7 support](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1805)
* [PUP-2411: Remove 1.8.7 multibyte string support in Lexer2](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2411)
* [PUP-2563: Remove 1.8.7 support in the ruby code base](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2563)
* [PUP-2412: Remove 1.8.7 function API support](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2412)


### OS Support

* [PUP-3553: Remove support for OSX versions <= 10.6](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3553)
    this mostly relates to setting user passwords and managing services.

## BREAK: Next Version of Puppet Language

By far the most significant user-facing change in Puppet 4 is the completely rewritten parser and evaluator, which are the parts of Puppet that take your modules and transform them into a catalog for each node that checks in. This was originally introduced as an opt-in "Future Parser", and over the last year, community feedback, user research, and engineering time have honed the Future Parser to the point where it's no longer in the realm of the future â€“ it's here.

The rewritten parser includes new capabilities like iteration and type-checking for variables as well as deprecations and changed behaviour. Most notably, the stricter, more predictable parsing of numbers, empty strings, and "undef"/"nil" comparisons may cause changes to a node's catalog without necessarily producing an error.

* [PUP-410: Complete Implementation of Language based on the EGrammar](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-410)
* [PUP-3274: Remove old parser/evaluator](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3274)
* [PUP-3133: Decide on the specification of Integer/Float runtime types](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3133)

* [PUP-3680: The parameter order on the hash type is inconsistent](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3680)
* [PUP-3240: Remove ignoreimport setting](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3240)
    (import was removed in future parser in 3.5.0, see PUP-490)
* [PUP-494: Make future parser/evaluator have acceptable performance](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-494)
* [PUP-3701: Issue with empty export resources expression in the Puppet future parser](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3701)
* [PUP-3718: defined function does not handle qualified variable names correctly](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3718)

## BREAK: Directory Environments Replace Config File Environments

Starting with Puppet 3.6, Directory Environments started taking over from Dynamic Environments as Puppet's mechanism for serving different versions of modules and code. In Puppet 4, they're the default and other environment support is gone. Read more about directory environments in the [environments section of the docs](/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html).

* [PUP-3268: Remove non-directory environment support](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3268)
* [PUP-3567: Remove current_environment check in Puppet::Indirector::Request#environment=](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3567)
* [PUP-4094: Default environment_timeout should be 0, not infinity.](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4094)
* [PUP-4067: Create production environment directories in packaging](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4067)
* [PUP-4083: Add sample environment.conf to puppet](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4083)


## BREAK: Removed Puppet Kick, ActiveRecord, and Inventory Service

There's been a lot of accumulated technical debt in Puppet's code base: old features which were deprecated but never removed, half-implemented experiments, and interested things that turned out to be really bad ideas. Almost 60,000 lines of code have been removed from the repository, comprising things like the pre-PuppetDB stored configs, `puppet kick`, and an unsupported CouchDB facts terminus.

* [PUP-862: Remove deprecated items for the Puppet 4 release](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-862) the epic for a bunch of the above.
* [PUP-2560: Remove inventory service on the master](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2560)
* [PUP-2559: Remove couchdb facts terminus and associated settings](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2559)
* [PUP-3249: Remove async_storeconfigs and queue service on the master](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3249)
    see summary in the old deprecations pages. actually that holds true for most of the above.
* Puppet kick:
    * [PUP-84: Disable unnecessary termini, Puppet::Resource::Ral should never be enabled in the puppet master application](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-84)
* [PUP-3267: Remove puppet kick and related agent functionality](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3267)
* [PUP-3269: Remove network access to the Resource indirection](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3269)
* [PUP-405: Remove ActiveRecord stored configs](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-405)
* [PUP-2560: Remove inventory service on the master](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2560)
* [PUP-4074: Remove master settings from puppet.conf](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4074)


## BREAK: HTTP API Changes

An important set of changes in Puppet 4 involve the URLs the agents and master use to communicate with one another over the network. We've standardized the endpoints onto the same namespaced, versioned standard as other Puppet projects like PuppetDB, which should make for much better compatibility guarantees. A side effect of this, however, is that currently Puppet 3 agents cannot talk to Puppet 4 masters; this compatbility layer will be introduced in Puppet-Server 2.1. See the upgrade docs for [servers](./upgrade_server.html) and [agents](./upgrade_agent.html) for step-by-step instructions to safely update your existing infrastructure.

* [PUP-3641: Changes to Puppet URL structure](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3641)
* [PUP-3519: Scope URL rework](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3519)

* [PUP-3644: move all legacy and v2.0 endpoints to v3](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3644)
* [PUP-3645: allow configurable URL prefix for all routes](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3645)

* [PUP-3958: Puppet agent requests do not include the X-Puppet-Version header](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3958)
* [PUP-3355: Remove PSON document_type](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3355)



## New Language Features

In addition to the core language changes, there are some new functions available along with a new function API that's written on top of the 4.x parser. No longer will you have to restart a long-running puppetmaster to get it to pick up new versions of your function code! One of the coolest built-in functions is "EPP", or Embedded Puppet, which enables inline and file-based templates similar to ERB (Embedded Ruby) but written in the Puppet Language directly. This helps reduce the cognitive dissonance of switching back and forth between the Puppet Language and Ruby ("Are my variables prefixed with dollar signs or not?!") and lets you use the Puppet's tooling for templates as well as your manifests. Read more about EPP in the [function reference guide][refguide].

* [PUP-2904: Make string/symbol use consistent in new function API](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2904)
* [PUP-2531: Provide validation tool for EPP](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2531)



## Changes to support Puppet Server and CA

* [PUP-3676: Avoid OpenSSL::X509::Name calls in ssl.rb for Puppet Server](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3676)
* [PUP-3522: Ruby OpenSSL executed implicitly in JVM-Puppet by loading Puppet/Util module](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3522)
* [PUP-4194: Puppet's logdir permissions prevent puppetserver service start](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4194)
* [PUP-3520: Move the Puppet extension OIDs definitions](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3520)
* [PUP-3986: Expand predefined OID's for Puppet's extension attributes](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3986)
* [PUP-2995: Proposal for custom trusted oid mapping file](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2995)

* [PUP-1035: Default setting for pluginsource problematic for deployments using SRV records](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1035)

## BREAK: Puppet Doc and Tagmail Removed from Core, Released as Modules

For users of `puppet doc`, check out the new [puppetlabs-strings](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/strings/) module on the Forge. `puppet doc` relied on RDoc behaviours which broke in newer Ruby versions. Similarly, the tagmail report processor didn't work under Puppet Server and it seemed like a good candidate to move into a modules, so it's available at [puppetlabs-tagmail](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/tagmail) on the Forge.

* [PUP-3463: Remove tagmail](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3463)
    https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/tagmail
* [PUP-3638: Remove the manifest handling code from the util/rdoc parsers.](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3638)

## Internal Cleanups and Dead Code Removal

Nearly all users can ignore these removals, but we're including them for completeness's sake.

* [PUP-880: Remove "localconfig" Setting](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-880)
* [PUP-3627: Remove ignored certdnsnames setting](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3627)

## BREAK: Resource Types/Providers With Changed Behavior

* [PUP-3719: Group resource non-authoritative by default](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3719)
* On the SUSE family of Linuxes, the default package provider is now zypper instead of rug. [PUP-2728: zypper should always be the default package provider for Suse osfamily](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2728)
* [PUP-2613: Change source_permissions default to :ignore](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2613)
* [PUP-2609: Don't allow source_permissions to be set to anything other than ignore on Windows](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2609)
* [PUP-3280: Remove msi provider](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3280)
* [PUP-3305: Change allow_virtual default to true](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3305)
* [PUP-1244: Yum provider using "version-release" to validate installation.](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1244)
    this is a long-running bug where ensure => "version of package, but without the -release suffix" would cause errors.
    the break is that some version comparisons might go differently, now.
* [PUP-2576: Implement behavioral change in the crontab provider to allow more drastic purging](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2576)
* [PUP-2350: Remove support for non-string mode of file type](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2350)

* [PUP-3308: Remove deprecation warning about cron purge change](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3308)


## BREAK: Internal API and Implementation Changes

These changes affect Puppet's internal Ruby methods and libraries. Their removal should affect either no one, or a small number of extension authors.

Most of these changes remove code that was previously deprecated.

## Stuff a lot of people will notice

A lot of these changes codify defaults changes that were deprecated or on-the-way in Puppet 3.x but couldn't flip over to be the default except on a semver major number boundary. For example, the `stringify_facts` setting (which causes the agent to submit all Facter facts as strings) is gone, because non-stringified-facts are now the default. Similarly, the Modulefile which described puppet module metadata was deprecated in 3.5 in favour of the `metadata.json` file, and now the transitional support for it is gone completely.

Module authors who use the `prefetch` method in custom providers may want to be aware of the changes in PUP-3656. Two things to consider:
  1. Previously, the prefetch method could throw any exception and puppet would carry on. As discussed above this is the wrong behavior in general, however some module authors may have stumbled across this, allowed/encouraged prefetch to throw exceptions, and let puppet runs succeed. So modules should be examined for this assumption.
  2. The only two legitimate causes for prefetch to throw an exception now are `LoadError` and (added in this puppet 4.0) `Puppet::MissingCommand`

* [PUP-3096: trusted_node_data option should go away (should be always-on)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3096)
* [PUP-3678: Invalid module name .DS_Store error running puppet apply](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3678)

* [PUP-3272: Remove support for yaml on the network](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3272)
    notably, `report_serialization_format` setting is gone.
* [PUP-3260: Remove RRD functionality from Puppet](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3260)

* [PUP-779: Remove deprecated process execution methods in util](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-779)
* The `libdir` setting can only be set to a single directory. Previously, you could set it to a list of directories, but only when using Puppet as a library. This was usually used for testing modules with multiple dependencies. If you need to do this in Puppet 4 or later, you should manipulate Ruby's `$LOAD_PATH` instead.

### Resource Type and Provider Improvements

The biggest change in this category is [PUP-1073](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1073), which implements a long-standing feature request. The Type docs have the details, but now you can, for example, have the same package name like "mysql" managed by two separate resources, one for the gem version and one for the RPM version.

* The [`yumrepo` type][type_yumrepo] now includes `assumeyes`, `deltarpm_percentage`, and `deltarpm_metadata_percentage` attributes. [PUP-3024: yumrepo: add setting deltarpm_percentage](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3024), [PUP-2923: Add assumeyes attribute to yumrepo](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2923)

### Resource Type and Provider Bugs

Some of these are subtle, some more in-your-face, but for the most part these bugfixes caused Puppet to behave slightly differently -- better, but differently -- and therefore had to wait for Puppet 4.0 to see the light of day.

* [PUP-3787: puppet resource file 'mode' parameter is 3-digit notation instead of 4-digit](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3787)

    for mac package providers.
* [PUP-3373: 'mount' resource with list of mount options only applies the first option](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3373)

### On OpenBSD

Thanks to Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse and Zach Leslie for these changes to help Puppet work better on BSDs.

* [PUP-3243: There's no way the 'bsd' service provider will work on OpenBSD](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3243)

* [PUP-3723: Add support for setting a user's login class](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3723) -- only affects openbsd for now. new `loginclass` attribute.

### On Windows

On Windows, `group` resources now respect the `auth_membership` attribute, which lets you control whether `members` is the complete list of members or a minimum list of members. (Previously, Puppet ignored this attribute on Windows.) Note that the default value of this attribute has also changed; see the breaking changes section on resource types.

Weekly `scheduled_task` resources would attempt to set the trigger on every run, due to part of the trigger being compared to the wrong thing. This is fixed.

* [PUP-2628: Ability to add a member to a group, instead of specifying the complete list](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-2628)
