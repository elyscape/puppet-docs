# 3.x to 4.0 Agent Upgrade Steps

## Linux hosts

If you have currently running Puppet agents that you want to update to Puppet 4, make sure you have followed the [Server
upgrade instructions](server_upgrade.markdown) on at least one host so the agents will have a Puppet 4 server to talk to.

* Install the puppetlabs-pc1-release package for your OS, per the regular install instructions.
* Make a note of the current `ssldir` location by running (as root) `puppet agent --configprint ssldir`; you'll need
  this to avoid re-issuing certificates.
* Disable the previous `products` and `devel` repositories
* Using your package manager, install the `puppet-agent` package for your operating system.
* Modify the new, Puppet 4-compatible `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf` file to include any local customizations from
  the old `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf` configuration file, taking note of the (deprecated and changed
  settings)[release_notes.html#XXX_Settings_header] which should not be copied over (notably, if you previously set
  `stringify_facts=false`, this is no longer necessary).  You will need to set the `server` (and `ca_server`, if you've
  set up a separate Puppet 4 CA) setting to point at the hostname of your new Puppet 4 master.
* Copy your SSL certificate tree from its previous location (from `puppet agent --configprint ssldir` above) to its new
  AIO path: `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl`, making sure to preserve permissions and ownership. For example:

    cp -rp /var/lib/puppet/ssl /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl

* Run the agent manually and make sure it correctly talks to the server:

    /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet -tv

* Ensure that Puppet will continue to run automatically. If you used a cron job to periodically run `puppet agent -t`,
make sure you update the path to the binary; if you run puppet as a daemon, ensure it's set to start up on system boot.
Here's a handy `puppet resource` command to do just that:

   /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppetagent ensure=running enabled=true
