How to Upgrade
-----

Before upgrading, **look at the table of contents above and see if there are any "UPGRADE WARNING" or "Upgrade Note" items for the new version.** Although it's usually safe to upgrade from any 3.x version to any later 3.x version, there are sometimes special conditions that can cause trouble.

We always recommend that you **upgrade your Puppet master servers before upgrading the agents they serve.**

If you're upgrading from Puppet 2.x, please [learn about major upgrades of Puppet first!][upgrade] We have important advice about upgrade plans and package management practices. The short version is: test first, roll out in stages, give yourself plenty of time to work with. Also, read the [release notes for Puppet 3][puppet_3] for a list of all the breaking changes made between the 2.x and 3.x series.


## Puppet 3.8.0

Released April 28, 2015, as part of Puppet Enterprise 3.8.0. The first official open source release in the 3.8 series will be 3.8.1.

Puppet 3.8.0 is a backward-compatible features and fixes release in the Puppet 3 series.

### New Feature: Back-end Support for Upgrade Previews

This version includes several backend changes to support the PE-only compilation preview module.

* [PUP-4113: Migrate and Preview 3.8 Language to 4.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4113)

### New Feature: Logging as JSON

In any of the Puppet subcommands that take the `--logdest` command line option, you can now specify a path to a JSON file and Puppet will log a (partial) JSON array of message objects to that file.

* [PUP-4201: Add support for structured logging](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4201)
* [PUP-4336](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4336) and [PUP-4341](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4341) cover bugs in this feature that were fixed before release.


### Improvements: Resource Types and Providers

* [PUP-1628: Add mount provider for AIX](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1628)
* [PUP-1291: scheduled_task : add support for "every X minutes or hours" mode](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1291)


### Bug Fixes: Resource Types and Providers

#### Windows

* On Windows, the `group` resource type would ignore the `auth_membership` attribute and always treat the list of members as a complete list, removing any users not listed in that `group` resource. This was also fixed in Puppet 4.0.0. [PUP-4185: Backport ability to add a member to group to Puppet 3.8](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4185)
* [PUP-1279: Windows Group and User fail during deletion even though it is successful](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1279)
* [PUP-3653: Unable to create/force empty Windows groups](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3653)
* [PUP-3804: User resource cannot add DOMAIN\User style accounts (through Active Directory) and should emit error message](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3804)
* [PUP-4390: Regression: Windows service provider fails to retrieve current state on 2003](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4390)
* Weekly `scheduled_task` resources were logging incorrect change notifications. This was also fixed in Puppet 4.0.0. [PUP-4186: Backport Weekly tasks always notify 'trigger changed' to Puppet 3.8](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4186)

#### Other Operating Systems

* [PUP-4345: Port PUP-3388 "Issue Creating Multiple Mirrors in Zpool Resource" to PUP 3.8](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4345)
* [PUP-4090: Zypper provider doesn't work correctly on SLES 10.4 with install_options set](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4090)

### Improvements: Future Language

* [PUP-4277: Case and Selector match should be deep](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4277)

### Bug Fixes: Future Language

* [PUP-4379: Future parser interpolation with [] after variable prefixed with underscore](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4379)
* [PUP-4278: unless with else when then part is empty produces nil result (future parser)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4278)

### Bug Fixes: General

* [PUP-927: puppet apply on Windows always uses *nix style newlines from templates](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-927)
* [PUP-3863: hiera('some::key', undef) returns empty string](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3863)
* [PUP-4334: hiera_include stopped working](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4334)
* [PUP-4190: CLONE - Puppet device displays credentials in plain text when run manually](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4190)
* [PUP-4187: Backport Puppet should execute ruby.exe not cmd.exe when running as a Windows to Puppet 3.8](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4187)
